\title{Allocation of varieties to farmers}
\usage{
expDesign(nvar, nobs, method, marker = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{nvar}{the number of varieties}

\item{nobs}{the number of farmers (observers), must be greater than or equal to nvar / 3}

\item{method}{must be one of "alpha", "random", "KM1", "KM2", "KM3", "KM4", "KM5", "KM6",
"GD1", "GD2", "GD3", "GD4", "GD5", "GD6", "GD7", "GD8", "GD9"}

\item{marker}{for KM1~KM6 and GD1~GD9, a nvar * nloci matrix should be specified, which is coded in (-1, 0, 1)
and is allowed to have NA entry}
}
\value{
an nobs * 3 matrix, with each row being the label of varieties assigned to that farmer
}
\description{
Generate experimental designs to allocate vartieties to farmers.
17 experimental designs are included, namely they are AP, RD, KM1~KM6, GD1~GD9 (see the vignette for details)
}
\examples{
#use alpha design
expDesign(120, 245, method = 'alpha')

#use GD2
data(marker)
M = marker[sample(368, 120), ] #the marker matrix
expDesign(120, 245, method = 'GD2', marker = M)
