\title{Rank aggregation using linear models}
\usage{
rankLM(data, K = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a n * m matrix,
where n is the number of observers and m is the number of items to rank;
each row vector is a partial or complete ranking,
with i-th element being the rank assined to item i;
the entry where that item is not ranked in the partial ranking is replaced by 0}

\item{K}{the additive relationship matrix; if provided, it will be used to specify the covariance structure
of the linear model}
}
\value{
Return a list with two components:
    \item{ranks}{a vector where the i-th element is the rank assigned to the i-th item.}
    \item{ranking}{a vector where the i-th element is the item ranked in the i-th place}
}
\description{
Aggregate the ranking from triple comparisons into a consensus ranking using linear models.
